# Atm-management-
simple python based Atm Management System
OOP Mini Project (Python)

A Python mini project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
This project exists to prove one thing only: that you understand classes, objects, constructors, and methods—not that you can build enterprise software.

If you think this is “advanced,” you’re fooling yourself. It’s foundational.

Key Concepts Used

Classes and Objects

__init__ constructor

Instance variables

Methods

Basic control flow

No frameworks. No libraries. No shortcuts.

Project Structure
MINI_PROJECT_2_on_OOP_.ipynb


Written as a Jupyter Notebook

Code is executed sequentially

Can be converted to a .py file with minimal effort

Requirements

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

Nothing else. If this doesn’t run, your environment is broken.

How to Run
Option 1: Jupyter Notebook

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook MINI_PROJECT_2_on_OOP_.ipynb


Run all cells from top to bottom

Option 2: Python Script

If you actually understand Python:

Copy the code into a .py file

Run:

python main.py

Example Behavior
Object created successfully
Details initialized using constructor
Operations performed using class methods


Straightforward. Predictable. That’s the point.

Purpose of This Project

Let’s be blunt:

This project is:

✅ Practice for OOP fundamentals

✅ Acceptable as a college mini project

❌ Not impressive on its own

❌ Not portfolio-ready

If this is your end goal, you’re aiming too low.

What You Should Improve Next

If you want to grow instead of stagnating:

Separate logic into multiple classes

Add real-world use cases

Implement error handling

Add file handling or persistence

Stop using notebooks for everything

OOP means design, not just wrapping code in a class and calling it a day.
